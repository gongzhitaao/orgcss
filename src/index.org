This article serves as a complete demonstration for my [[file:org.css][org.css]], a simple and
clean stylesheet for org-exported HTML file.  You may switch between the default
style provided by Emacs Org mode, i.e., styles specified in the variable
=org-html-style-default= and my customized stylesheet using the button at the
top left corner.

[[http://orgmode.org/][Org mode]] is for keeping notes[fn:1], maintaining TODO lists, planning projects,
and authoring documents with a fast and effective /plain-text/ system[fn:2]
cite:dominik2003-org.

#+END_QUOTE

Org mode was created by Carsten Dominik back in 2003.  It is a built-in major
mode in [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]].  It's similar to [[http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax][markdown]] cite:gruber2004-markdown, where all
editing is done in plain text with some character markups to decorate texts and
finally the text file can be exported to some other formats, e.g., HTML.  The
philosophy is that we can concentrate on the contents with as few distraction
from the styles as possible, i.e., as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is
feasible.  However, the original markdown is a markup language used to create
web pages, while Org mode provides much richer functionality beyond simple text
markup, e.g., a complete [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done][Getting Things Done (GTD)]] system, task timing and
reminder, complete system for reproducible research, etc.  In this article
however we only focus on one of its uses, /generating HTML pages/.  I will
assume that readers are already familiar with Emacs and org mode, otherwise
please refer to [[http://orgmode.org/][orgmode.org]] and [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/]] for
introduction.

* Related Markdowns
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec:related-markdowns

[[https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/][Markdown 1.0.1]] was first released back in 2004.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers.  Markdown allows you
to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it
to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

#+END_QUOTE

There are many flavors of markdowns and tools.  The followings are some that I
really like.  For a more complete list of markdown flavors, see [[http://pandoc.org/][Pandoc]].

[[https://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/][Texinfo]] uses a single source file to produce output in a number of formats, both
online and printed (dvi, html, info, pdf, xml, etc.).  It is well-integrated in
Emacs.

* Motivation
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec:motivation
:END:

As a heavy Emacs user, [[https://www.google.com/search?q%3Dblogging%2Bwith%2Borg%2Bmode][blogging with org mode]] is a natural choice.  I'm keeping
notes in org mode, and I may want to publish some of them online.  Questions
like why not use products like MS OneNote or Google Keep or Wordpress or
whatever simply boil down to personal preference.

1. Org file is a simple text file which can be processed efficiently by external
   programs.
2. It has good built-in support from Emacs, and
3. can be exported to various formats, /TeX/, /PDF/ and /HTML/.  Except for some
   special cases where dedicated styles are needed, say academic papers, the
   default export styles with simple tweaks usually satisfy my needs.  However,
   the default style provided by org html exporter is simple /boring/.  So I
   decide to tweak the stylesheet a little bit to make it /clean/, /simple/ and
   more /eye appealing/.

Source code of this file is available at https://github.com/gongzhitaao/orgcss.

* Setup
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec:setup
:END:

Publishing with org mode can be achieved as simple as a few keystrokes (say
{{{kbd(C-c C-e h h)}}} for html exporting and {{{kbd(C-c C-e l p)}}} for pdf
exporting).  We omit the publishing configuration as the main goal of this
article is to demo my stylesheet.  The process can be meticulously tweaked
following the [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Publishing.html#Publishing][instruction here.]]  Actually in my current setup, no tweaks and
special configurations are needed.  All remains default and works out of the
box.

** External Utilities
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec:external-utilities
:END:

Table [[tab:util]] list all the external utilities I used for publishing and
rendering.

#+CAPTION: Utilities
#+NAME: tab:util
| Utility     | Description                                     |
|-------------+-------------------------------------------------|
| [[https://www.lri.fr/~filliatr/bibtex2html/][bibtex2html]] | Export citations in bib files, if any, to html. |
| [[https://www.mathjax.org/][MathJax]]     | Render math equations.                          |

Here are some notes about the above utility.

- ~bibtex2html~ is optional if no citation is required.  Citation syntax is
  =\cite{key}=, or =cite:key=.  To use this functionality, you need to include
  the following elisp code in your configuration.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'ox-bibtex)
  #+END_SRC

  I do not have a better option for HTML bibtex export.  I think an ideal
  solution is pure lisp-based or Javascript-based.  The problem with
  Javascript-based solution is that the back-reference might be difficult to
  implement.

- I use [[https://www.mathjax.org/][MathJax]] inline rendering for equations despite of its speed.  It is said
  that [[http://khan.github.io/KaTeX/][KaTeX]] loads and renders faster than MathJax, however, the former supports
  only a subset of \(\LaTeX\) syntax.  See the [[http://www.intmath.com/cg5/katex-mathjax-comparison.php][comparison]] between the two.
  Anyway, I do not have that many equations to show off.

** Org Templates

The following is my org file template for blogging.

#+BEGIN_SRC org

# prints out bibliograph, if any, with bibtex2html.  The first parameter is the
# bibliograph file name without .bib extension, the second is the reference
# style.  The rest parameters are parsed to `bibtex2html'.  Refer to the
# ox-bibtex document for further information.

,#+BIBLIOGRAPHY: ref plain limit:t option:-nokeywords

# This is an automatically generated section if you use footnote.
,* Footnotes
#+END_SRC

With all these setup, only one thing is left, i.e., tweaking the styles of
exported html.  By default, The HTML exporter assigns some [[http://orgmode.org/manual/CSS-support.html][special CSS classes]]
to appropriate parts of the document and your style specifications may change
these, in addition to any of the standard classes like for headlines, tables,
etc.  The list is actually not complete, you may want to export a test org file
and read the source of exported html file to find out what classes are
available.  The current page shows off my org.css.  Some other good styles for
org-exported html can be found on [[http://orgmode.org/]],
[[http://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.html]] and etc.

* Known Issues
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec:known-issues
:END:

The citation exporter, =ox-bibtex=, does NOT work seamlessly.  As of =Org-mode
8.3.2=, I have the following issues.

** +Dangling Element+                                                :solved:
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec:dangling-element
:END:

The lisp function =insert-file-contents= used in =ox-bibtex= does not move point
and insertion-marker to the end of inserted text (I'm not sure it is a bug or an
intention).  The result is that the citation is a dangling table not included in
the bibliography div.

The expected result is

#+BEGIN_SRC html
<div id="bibliography">
  <h2>Bibliography</h2>
  <table>
  <!-- Citation content goes here -->
  </table>
</div>
#+END_SRC

But we got

#+BEGIN_SRC html
<div id="bibliography">
  <h2>Bibliography</h2>
</div>
<table>
<!-- Citation content goes here -->
</table>
#+END_SRC

Unless a patch is submitted, we may need to manually adjust this weird result.

** +Bibliography in Wrong Section+                                     :solved:
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec:bibliograph-in-wrong-section
:END:

The exported bibliography is always included in some other section div instead
of a stand-lone section.

The expected result is

#+BEGIN_SRC html
<div id="outline-container-1" class="outline-2">
  <!-- section 1 -->
</div>
<div id="outline-container-2" class="outline-2">
  <!-- section 2 -->
</div>
<div id="outline-container-3" class="outline-2">
  <!-- section 3 -->
</div>
<div id="bibliography">
  <!-- bibliography goes here -->
</div>
#+END_SRC

But we got

#+BEGIN_SRC html
<div id="outline-container-1" class="outline-2">
  <!-- section 1 -->
</div>
<div id="outline-container-2" class="outline-2">
  <!-- section 2 -->
</div>
<div id="outline-container-3" class="outline-2">
  <!-- section 3 -->
  <div id="bibliography">
    <!-- bibliography goes here -->
  </div>
</div>
#+END_SRC

The problem is that the =#+BIBLIOGRAPHY= command is always ignored unless it is
belonged to a section.  +This is due to the internal implementation of keyword+
+parser of =ox-html=.  Currently hacking some post-processing code is the only+
+solution if you do not want to do it manually+.

This problem is solved as follows.

1. Add the following snippet to your ~init.el~

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'ox-extra)
(ox-extras-activate '(ignore-headlines))
   #+END_SRC

2. adding =ignore= tag to whichever headline you want to ignore.  Note that this
   is different from the =COMMENT= in Org mode in that =COMMENT= ignores the
   head and contents in its section, while =ignore= only ignores the headline
   but keeps the contents when exporting.  See the above template.

** Wrong Back Reference
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec:wrong-back-reference
:END:

The links generated by =ox-bibtex= is also troublesome.  Given =ref.bib=,
=bibtex2html= will generate two files, =reb_bib.html= and =ref.html=.  The
utility =ox-bibtex= directly inserts contents of =ref.html= to the current
exported html.  Now when you click links in the exported html, you will be
directed to =ref_bib.html=.  And when expecting to get back to the exported html
by clicking links in =ref_bib.html=, you will be instead directed to =ref.html=.
My solution is to +remove the bibliograph source with =option:-nobibsource=+
replace the link in =ref_bib.html= with when compiling the HTML (see this
[[https://github.com/gongzhitaao/orgcss/blob/master/gulpfile.js#L49][gulpfile.js]]), it is a hacky way though.

** ~fci-mode~ Issue
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h2-fci-mode-issue
:END:

If you use [[https://github.com/alpaker/Fill-Column-Indicator][~fci-mode~]], and it is turned on in the major code of your
to-be-exported source code section, you will notice some dummy characters
at each newline (as of ~Org-v9.1.14~) like the followings.

#+BEGIN_SRC c++
#include <iostream>
using namesapce std;

int main()
{
  return 0;
}
#+END_SRC

I did not have this issue with previous version of ~org-mode~ and ~fci-mode~.
Simply turning off the ~fci-mode~ for major mode solves the problem.

* Conclusion
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec:conclusion
:END:

This article essentially demonstrates my stylesheet for org-exported html file
without going into details about the publishing process which requires some
knowledge about Emacs and org mode.  There are some dangling issues around the
citation with =ox-bibtex=, to which the simple solution is to use links instead
of citations, if possible.  Otherwise, hacking some post-processing code is
necessary.
